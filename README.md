#### Q. ***What are indexes in a Database? What are the types of indexes***
An index is a database structure that you can use to improve the performance of database activity. A database table can have one or more indexes associated with it. An index is defined by a field expression that you specify when you create the index. Typically, the field expression is a single field name, like EMP_ID.

#### Q. ***What are the different tables present in MySQL***
Note that MySQL supports two different kinds of tables: transaction-safe tables (InnoDB and BDB) and non-transaction-safe tables (HEAP, ISAM, MERGE, and MyISAM). Advantages of transaction-safe tables (TST): Safer.
#### Q. ***What are the technical features of MySQL*** 
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) MySQL is a relational database management system.  
1. Easy to use. MySQL is easy to use.  
2. It is secure.  
3. Client/ Server Architecture.  
4. Free to download.  
5. It is scalable.  
6. Speed.  
7. High Flexibility.  

#### Q. ***Explain SELECT, LIKE, IN, Regular-Expression, Datatypes, Sub-Query in mySQL***
#### Q. ***Explain JOIN Query in mySQL***
A `JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.  
Take `users` table and `orders` table for example.  
Users  

|user_id|name|mobile|
|---|---|---|
|1|John|123|
|2|Joe|124|

Orders  

|order_id|user_id|total|created_at|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|1|500|2021-12-19 18:32:00|
|2|1|800|2021-12-03 08:32:00|
|3|2|50|2021-12-13 12:49:00|
|4|1|80|2021-12-15 21:19:00|

So to get the list of orders with names and mobile nos. for each order, we can join `orders` and `users` on the basis of `user_id`.  
```
select o.*, u.name, u.mobile from ordes o join users u on o.user_id = u.user_id;
```

#### Q. ***Explain Stored Procedure, View, Event, triggers in mySQL***
#### Q. ***Explain Transaction in mySQL***
#### Q. ***What is difference between procedures and triggers***
#### Q. ***How do you find third highest salary***

```
#### Q. ***How to prevent from database attacks/SQL Injection***
#### Q. ***How many TRIGGERS are possible in MySql***
#### Q. ***What are Heap tables***
#### Q. ***What is the difference between BLOB AND TEXT***
#### Q. ***Explain advantages of MyISAM over InnoDB***
#### Q. ***What are the differences between MySQL_fetch_array(), MySQL_fetch_object(), MySQL_fetch_row()***
#### Q. ***How to find the unique values if the value in the column is repeated***
#### Q. ***Define REGEXP*** 
#### Q. ***Difference between CHAR and VARCHAR*** 
Both of them are used for string type data. `char` has fixed length and if the inserted data is less than the defined length, required no. of blank spaces are added as padding. `varchar` has variable length and no padding is used to fill up the left out space. So technically, `varchar` will save space.
#### Q. ***Give string types available for column***
#### Q. ***What are the nonstandard string types***
#### Q. ***What are all the Common SQL Function***
